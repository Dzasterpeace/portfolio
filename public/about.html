<h1>About Alex Johnson</h1>

<h2>Welcome to My World of Design!</h2>
<p>
  Hi there! I’m Alex Johnson, a passionate freelance graphic designer based in Seattle, Washington. For over a decade, I've been bringing concepts to life through innovative design solutions. Welcome to my corner of the internet where creativity meets functionality.
</p>

<h4>My Journey</h4>
<p>
  I was always the kid who doodled in every notebook and dreamed in vivid colors. My journey into graphic design started at the University of Washington, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication Design. Post-graduation, I dove into the freelance world and haven't looked back since.
</p>

<h4>What I Do</h4>
<ul>
  <label>As a graphic designer, I specialize in:</label>
  <li>Branding and Identity: Crafting unique brand images that resonate and endure.</li>
  <li>Digital Illustration: Bringing ideas to life with visually captivating illustrations.</li>
  <li>Web Design: Creating user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing websites.</li>
  <li>Print Design: From business cards to billboards, designing with an eye for detail and a flair for creativity.</li>
</ul>

<h4>My Philosophy</h4>
<p>
I believe in design that tells a story. Each project is an adventure, and my role is to weave your vision into a visual narrative that captivates and communicates. Good design is not just about looking great; it's about creating an experience and sparking a connection.

<h4>When I’m Not Designing...</h4>
<p>
I'm probably hiking in the Cascades, experimenting with street photography, or indulging in my love for Seattle's vibrant coffee scene. I believe in living a balanced life where passions outside of work fuel my professional creativity.
